# github-for-me
It is an intro part how to use github via desktop and a command line
I made here some unsignificant changes for an arbitrary html code.
I studied how to:
  1. Clone a folder
  2. Change and commit changes
  3. Push it on Github
  4. Merge that changes
  5. Create a new branch

Now I am testing how to pull changes from GitHub
